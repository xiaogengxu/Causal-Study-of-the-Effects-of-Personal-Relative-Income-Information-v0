    <p>This research project is a collaboration between Statistics Finland (Tilastokeskus, Statistikcentralen),
        Hanken School of Economics, and Tampere University. Your personal data will be processed securely according
        to the data protection policy and ethical guidelines of both Statistics Finland and Hanken School of Economics.
        The legal ground for processing your data is your consent and the Finnish Data Protection Act. The online
        questionnaire uses closed form or multiple choice question formats only.</p>

    <p>Your contact information was received/sampled for this study from Statistics Finland.</p>

    <p>The study is about earnings and income. You will first be asked a few questions on this topic. You will be then
        told some facts about your and other Finnsâ€™ incomes. You will then answer several questions of relevance for
        the study.</p>

    <p>Towards the end, there are also questions where you have a chance for monetary reward and the reward will depend
        on the answers you give and other factors not in your control. (In order to be compensated, you should complete
        the questionnaire in its entirety.) The questions associated with a monetary reward are clearly indicated.</p>

    <p>Once you are done, the data will be sent to Statistics Finland. The expert officials will extract the information
        regarding your reward, connect your reward data with your contact data (using the code in the top right corner
        of your questionnaire, the key of which is only available to the SF officials) and inform an external
        professional agent about these. The external agent is not related to the research theme and is unaware of the
        details of the study. No other information or data will be revealed to the external agent. The external agent
        then contacts you to finalize the payment.</p>
